# Kindling

## Project Background
Kindling was developed as part of the Imaginary Game Jam, a 2-week long event during Summer 2025. This game jam was exclusive to solo developers, meaning I built this game from scratch in 2 weeks, completely independently! The goal was to build a genre mash-up game with elements of Fantasy and Flesh Pit, while incorporating Rogue Climber's main characters, Gobbo & Furny.

## Premise
Kindling is a 2D survival-defense game where you must protect your living furnace, Furny, from waves of hostile winter creatures sent by a vengeful Santa. As the night grows colder and the enemies become stronger, your task is to collect pinecones, fend off attackers, and keep the fire alive until morning.

The game emphasizes tight resource loops and defensive strategy: fireballs must be rationed, walls can be repaired with a hammer, and pinecones fuel both your offense and survival. The player will face increasingly difficult encounters, from swarms of elves to lumbering treefolk and deceptive gifts.
